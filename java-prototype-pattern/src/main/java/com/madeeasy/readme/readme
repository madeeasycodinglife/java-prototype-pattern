**Java Prototype Pattern: Cloning Objects**

The Prototype Design Pattern is used to create new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype.
It allows you to create new objects with the same properties as an existing object, avoiding the need to recreate the object from scratch.

**Example:**

Here's an example of a prototype pattern in Java using the `clone()` method:

```java
class Person implements Cloneable {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    // Getter methods

    @Override
    public Person clone() {
        try {
            return (Person) super.clone();
        } catch (CloneNotSupportedException e) {
            throw new AssertionError();
        }
    }
}

public class PrototypeExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person original = new Person("Alice", 25);
        Person copy = original.clone();

        System.out.println("Original: " + original.getName() + ", " + original.getAge());
        System.out.println("Copy: " + copy.getName() + ", " + copy.getAge());
    }
}
```

**How to Identify When to Apply the Prototype Design Pattern:**

1. **Copying Objects:** When you need to create new objects that are similar to existing objects and want to avoid
manual object initialization.

2. **Complex Object Creation:** If creating an object involves complex initialization or a resource-intensive process,
the prototype pattern simplifies the process by copying an existing object.

3. **Immutable Objects:** When you want to create immutable objects, the prototype pattern allows you to create new
instances while keeping the original object unchanged.

**Where to Apply the Prototype Design Pattern:**

- **Object Cloning:** The prototype pattern is specifically designed for creating objects by cloning existing objects.

- **Resource-Intensive Objects:** Use it when creating objects with resource-intensive setup (e.g., database connections,
 file loading) to avoid repeating those setup steps.

- **Customized Instances:** When you need to create similar but customized instances based on a prototype object.

- **Stateful Objects:** If you want to create new instances of stateful objects while preserving the state of the original.

- **Immutable Objects:** To create immutable objects efficiently.

By applying the Prototype Design Pattern, you can efficiently create new instances of objects, especially when copying an
 existing object with a complex setup or when preserving the state of a stateful object.
